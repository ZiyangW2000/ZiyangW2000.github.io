In this work, We present Unified Embeddings for Multimodal Retrieval (UNIMUR), a simple but effective approach that embeds multimodal inputs and retrieves visual and textual outputs via frozen Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, UNIMUR jointly retrieves multimodal outputs via unified multimodal embedding and applies dual alignment training to account for both visual and textual semantics.
