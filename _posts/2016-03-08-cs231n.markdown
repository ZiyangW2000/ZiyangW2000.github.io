We present SiLVR, a Simple Language-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video understanding into two stages. In the first stage, SiLVR transforms raw video into language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short clip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language descriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex video-language understanding tasks. <strong>SiLVR has been awarded the 1st in Track 1B: Multi-Discipline Lecture Understanding at CVPR 2025 Multimodal Video Agent Workshop</strong>
